## React Todo App with API

This is my new training project and also it's one of my "must have apps" to manage things I need to do everyday. Just try it too!

[TODO APP](https://kreisberg.github.io/todo-app/)

### General info
In this Todo App you can:

- authorize by mail and the app will remember you and your todos;
- create new todos and change the status from 'active' to 'completed';
- if you've completed all of them or want to restore full list - just click on toggle left from the input;
- you can sort your todos by status and clear those that have already been completed;
- if you make mistakes or want to update something - double-click will converts the selected string to an input;
- and there is also a counter at the bottom, so you can see how many todos are left for today.

### Technologies

To create this App I used React.js with TypeScript, BEM and SASS (SCSS) methodology to optimize styling, working with Fetch API and used some custom Hooks.
